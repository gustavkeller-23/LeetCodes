# LeetCode Problems

### Objective

The objective of this project is to enhance problem-solving skills and improve coding proficiency through solving algorithmic challenges on LeetCode. The goal is to tackle a variety of problems across different domains such as arrays, strings, dynamic programming, and graph theory to build a robust understanding of these concepts.

### Introduction

LeetCode is a widely recognized platform for practicing coding challenges. It offers a comprehensive set of problems that can help users prepare for technical interviews, improve their coding skills, and gain a deeper understanding of various algorithms and data structures.

### Methodology

Problem Selection: Choose a diverse set of problems from LeetCode that cover different topics and difficulty levels.

Implementation: Solve each problem using a chosen programming language (C, JavaScript, Java).

Testing: Validate solutions with provided test cases and additional edge cases.

### Results

Through consistent practice and problem-solving on LeetCode, the following results were achieved:

1. Enhanced Problem-Solving Skills: Tackling a variety of algorithmic challenges helped in developing a structured approach to problem-solving.

2. Improved Coding Proficiency: Regular practice led to increased familiarity with different programming languages and their syntax.

3. Deeper Understanding of Algorithms: Solving problems from different domains provided a comprehensive understanding of fundamental algorithms and data structures.

4. Preparation for Technical Interviews: The practice on LeetCode served as a valuable resource for preparing for technical interviews, increasing confidence in coding interviews.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrated the effectiveness of using LeetCode as a tool for improving coding skills and problem-solving abilities. The systematic approach to selecting and solving problems contributed to significant personal growth in understanding complex algorithms and preparing for technical interviews.
